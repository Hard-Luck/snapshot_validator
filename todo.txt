write assertions

open min1000 cs5 into an {address: balances} dict
open balance check into an {address: balances} dict

for key, value in min 1000
	if balancecheck[key] == value:
		log key: Correct 
	else:
		log error difference is abs value - balance check key


Figure out the 0 error

reformat the min_1000.csv precessor 

check the assertions and create a logging mechanism

download remaining csvs

figure out a protocol for writing tests
